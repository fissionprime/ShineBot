# ShineBot
ShineBot was created during may 2017 in python 2.7 and was initially intended to serve as a chat bot for Michigan community Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments.
The project was put on the backburner ~August 2017, and I am now aiming to finish implementing its previously planned functionalities and bring the project to a more appropriate end.
ShineBot includes functionality for text-based commands (both single and multiple message), time-based cooldowns for chat commands, user permission levels, and a points system for chatters (since implemented as native functionality on twitch).
